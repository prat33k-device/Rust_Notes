### What I recommend for you (based on your recent Rust + DS learning)

If you want the **most practical + fastest CF improvement**:

✅ **CF Ladder 800–1600 (at each rating level solve 10-20 problems than move to next rating)+ 2 contests/week**
[CF Ladder 800-1600](https://codeforces.com/problemset?order=BY_RATING_ASC&tags=800-1600)
